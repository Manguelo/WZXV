     "longDesc": "WAYG-LP, God’s Way Radio, is an answer to many years of prayer. We first applied for our broadcasting licence in late 2013 (barely making the deadline) and were granted our construction permit on October 30th 2014. So after a year of prayer, and seeking the Lord we finally had the permission to start building. But we still didn’t have a name! So we continued to pray and ask God for His will and the name He would want for this radio station. We went through several ideas and revisions, always praying over them, and on January 1st 2015 God gave us the name, call letters, and verse He wanted for the station. God’s Way Radio was granted the call letters WAYG-LP that same month and Psalm 18:30 became the foundation for God’s Way Radio.“As for God, His way is perfect, the word of the LORD is proven; He is a shield to all those who trust in Him.” Psalm 18:30 From there on there was still lots of work to do both physically and spiritually. People were stretched, walls went up, lives were encouraged, and equipment was programmed. We began streaming 24/7 over the internet on December 20th 2015 and received an immediate response. Exactly one year later, on December 20th 2016, we began broadcasting over 104.7 FM in Miami, FL. It was truly a miraculous work of God that only He can take credit for. God’s Way Radio exists to proclaim God’s word and point people to Jesus, over the airwaves of Miami, and through the web anywhere in the world!"
